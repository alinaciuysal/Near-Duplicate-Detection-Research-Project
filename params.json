{"name":"Bilkent University CS490 Research Project","tagline":"","body":"# Semantic-duplicate Detection of Tweets\r\n\r\nDuplicate document detection topic has been studied for years in the information retrieval field of Computer Science. There exist \"state-of-art\" algorithms for detecting near-duplicate documents efficiently.\r\n\r\nIn this project, the duplicate tweets posted on Twitter in a specific time-line will be de-duplicated by lexical analysis of tweets in our dataset.\r\n\r\nStudent Name: Ali Naci Uysal\r\n\r\nProject Supervisor: Prof. Fazlı Can\r\n\r\n## Related Papers\r\n[Efficient Semantic-Aware Detection of Near Duplicate Resources](http://livingknowledge.europarchive.org/images/publications/semAwareNDD.pdf)\r\n[Groundhog Day: Near-Duplicate Detection on Twitter](http://www2013.wwwconference.org/proceedings/p1273.pdf)\r\n[CoDet: Sentence-based Containment Detection in News Corpora](http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~canf/publications/CoDet%20CIKM%202011.pdf)\r\n[Detecting Near-duplicates for Web Crawling](http://www2007.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/papers/paper215.pdf)\r\n[Collection Statistics for Fast Duplicate Document Detection](http://ir.cs.georgetown.edu/publications/downloads/p171-chowdhury.pdf)\r\n[Syntactic Clustering of the Web](http://acberg.com/bigdata/papers/broder_shingling.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Meetings\r\n1) January 25, 2016 in EA511: Project proposal report is revised and the topic of the project is narrowed down.\r\n\r\n## Quick Links\r\n[Bilkent University Computer Engineering Department](http://cs.bilkent.edu.tr/)\r\n\r\n[Prof. Fazlı Can's Homepage](http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~canf/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
